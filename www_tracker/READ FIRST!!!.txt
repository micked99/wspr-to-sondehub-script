2. You have to rename "empty.html" into the balloon name which you set up in the balloon.ini
In this case (example balloon.ini), the balloon name in the ini is NOCALL1, you have to rename "empty.html" into "NOCALL1.html".
If you have an second balloon in the air, then you need additional an html file with the name of the second balloon,
in this case it would be "NOCALL2.html".
